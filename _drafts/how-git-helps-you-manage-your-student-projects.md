As a student you probably have some way to organize your projects and files on your computer.
These may include assignments, personal projects, resumes and others.
Especially for larger and important projects you most likely create backups of your work.
If not, you will probably regret it at some point - trust me, I speak from experience :)

I used to send backups to my email or save them on a USB stick. 
However, the problem with these types of backups is that they take quite some time if
you have to create them manually. As your project grows, this process will take even longer.

Because humans are lazy, you will simply skip or forget about backing up your files. 
In case something goes wrong, this simple mistake might cost you hours or even days of work.

You might also have local backups, creating a folder for each new version.
This could quickly lead to a nightmare like this:
