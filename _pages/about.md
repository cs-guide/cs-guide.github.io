Hey, thanks for visiting my site! I'm Jonas and a computer science student at KIT
in Germany. I originally created CS-Guide to make Git and GitHub more accessible 
to beginners. I'd appreciate any constructive feedback and suggestions in the comments. Happy coding!

If you've never used Git before I would recommend starting with this post:  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-10-a-beginners-guide-to-git-and-github %}">A beginner's guide to Git and GitHub</a>
